**A/B Testing for Website Conversion Optimization**


his project demonstrates the design, simulation, and analysis of an A/B test to evaluate website conversion performance using Python. A/B testing is a fundamental technique in data-driven decision-making, commonly applied in marketing, product design, and UI/UX optimization.
**The objective** is to compare two versions of a website (Version A - Current, Version B - New Design) to determine which leads to better conversion rates.

1. Using simulated data, the project walks through:

2. Data generation for both groups

3. Calculation of conversion rates

4. Statistical significance testing using a Z-Test

5. Data visualization of results

6. Final business recommendations based on the analysis

**Tools & Technologies**
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)

Statistical Testing (Z-Test for Proportions using Statsmodels)

Data Visualization (Matplotlib)

**Key Steps in the Project**
1. Simulated website traffic data with realistic conversion probabilities
2. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to inspect dataset structure
3. Calculated conversion rates for each version
4. Applied Z-Test to assess statistical significance of observed differences
5. Visualized conversion rates using bar charts
6. Provided data-backed recommendations for website optimization

**Results & Insights**
Version B achieved a higher conversion rate compared to Version A

Z-Test indicated whether the observed difference is statistically significant (p-value < 0.05)

Business recommendation: Adopt the better-performing version to increase conversions and user engagement

**Business Impact**
This project showcases how data-driven experimentation can guide website design choices, enhancing user engagement and conversion performance using simple yet powerful statistical techniques.
